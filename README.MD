# CCN exercise with Keras

The output of the command console when I run the programe is:
```
Epoch 1/3
227/227 [==============================] - 361s 2s/step - loss: 698.3618 - accuracy: 0.6077
Epoch 2/3
227/227 [==============================] - 342s 2s/step - loss: 0.4775 - accuracy: 0.8222
Epoch 3/3
227/227 [==============================] - 328s 1s/step - loss: 0.4197 - accuracy: 0.8415
```

The code is not the prettiest code ever but at least it works
